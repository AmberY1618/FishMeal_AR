Project Brief

Author: Amber Yuan

This is an AR application built for the UBC Journalism Group. The UBC Journalism Group was doing a global reporting program and they wanted a travelling exhibit that travels around North America. Their objective is to let more people be aware of the hidden cost behind the seafood industry around the world. I built this travelling exhibit with a few other fellow students and played the role as the only programmer on the team.
